memory is 32 bit addresses 
addresses are stores in registers which are also 32 bits in nature 
not every byte has an address 
labels are symbolic names for addresses in program 
addresses may refer to either data or code 

assembler is a thin layer on top of binary code

.balign 4 is a directive that ensures that the next address starts on 4 byte boundary eg 

.balign 4 
myword: 
	.word 3

.word directive ensures that 3 is stored as 4 byte integer

.text is the code section of assembly 

.data is the data section of assembly

.data section contents can be modified by processor 
.test section content cannot be modified for security reasons

ldr r1,=myvar @ r1 <- &myvar, myvar in memory
