function are a good way to reuse code 

pass diff parameter and get a different result and hence a reuse

we must follow some rules while writing func at such low level of programming they are arm architecture procesure call standard 

r15 pc (program counter )
r14 lr (link register hold the addr of the instr following the instr that called us)
r13 sp (stack pointer, stores top of stack)

stack is area of memory owned only by the current function 

PASSING PARAMETERS 
the first four parameters if it to follow standards be stored sequentially in r0, r1, r2, r3,
for passing argc > 4 use stack

rules 
@ do not use cpsr 
@ free to modify the r0, r1, r2, r3 
@ can modify lr, but before that store its value somewhere as it will be used while exiting the function
@ can modify the gpr r4 to r11 but the contents must be restored before leaving the function

function should use r0 for returning data 

the scanf modifies the register contents after it returns 
do not use the register blindly if the function used in blind box to you
