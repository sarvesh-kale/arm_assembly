arm instr follow the template 

instr dest, src1, src2, [shifts]
instr dest, src2, [shifts]


the following instrs are imp 

lsl @ logical shift left 

mov r0, r1, lsl 3 @ r0 <- (2**3)*r1

similar instrs are 
lsr @ means logical shift right 
asr @ this is imp retains the msb in the last 
ror @ the whole register is treated as a circular chain 
 
these instruction can be combined with 
register src2 of the arm instruction 

rsb r1,r1,r1,lsl #3 @ put r1*8 - r1 in r1

rsb stands for reverse subtract

generic mul instructions is difficult to compute by our arm processor
